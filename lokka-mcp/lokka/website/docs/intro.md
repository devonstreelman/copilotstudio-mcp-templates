## What is Lokka?

Lokka is a simple yet powerful middleware that connects AI language models (like ChatGPT or Claude) to your Azure and Microsoft 365 tenant using the Azure and Microsoft Graph APIs.

This allows you to perform administrative tasks using natural language queries.

:::info
In technical terms, Lokka is an implementation of the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (MCP) for the Microsoft Graph and Azure APIs.

Here's a quick demo. Read on to learn how to set this up on your own machine.

### Sample queries

Here are some examples of queries you can use with Lokka.

- `Create a new security group called 'Sales and HR' with a dynamic rule based on the department attribute.`
- `Find all the conditional access policies that haven't excluded the emergency access account`
- `Show me all the Intune device configuration policies assigned to the 'Call center' group`
- `What was the most expensive service in Azure last month?`

You can ask Lokka to do anything that Microsoft Graph can do which includes support for Entra, Intune, Teams and SharePoint. In addition to graph you can also work with your Azure resources as well.

:::note
The agent will only be able to perform the actions based on the Graph and Azure permissions you grant it.
