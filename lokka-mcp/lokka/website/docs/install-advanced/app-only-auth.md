This authentication method uses the client credentials flow to authenticate the agent with Microsoft Graph API.

You can use either certificate (recommended) or client secret authentication with the following configuration. In both instances, you need to create a Microsoft Entra application and grant it the necessary permissions.

## Create an Entra app for App-Only auth with Lokka

- Open [Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) > **Identity** > **Applications** > **App registrations**
  - Tip: [enappreg.cmd.ms](https://enappreg.cmd.ms) is a shortcut to the App registrations page.
- Select **New registration**
- Enter a name for the application (e.g. `Lokka`)
- Select **Register**
- Select **API permissions** > **Add a permission**
  - Select **Microsoft Graph** > **Application permissions**
    - Search for each of the permissions and check the box next to each permission you want to allow.
      - The agent will only be able to perform the actions based on the permissions you grant it.
    - Select **Add permissions**
- Select **Grant admin consent for [your organization]**
- Select **Yes** to confirm

## Option 1: App-Only Auth with Certificate (recommended for app-only auth)

Once the app is created and you've added a certificate you can configure the cert's location as shown below.

```json
{
  "Lokka-Microsoft": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@merill/lokka"],
    "env": {
      "TENANT_ID": "<tenant-id>",
      "CLIENT_ID": "<client-id>",
      "CERTIFICATE_PATH": "/path/to/certificate.pem",
      "CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD": "<optional-certificate-password>",
      "USE_CERTIFICATE": "true"
    }
  }
}
```

Tip: Use the command below to convert a PFX client certificate to a PEM-encoded certificate.

```bash
openssl pkcs12 -in /path/to/cert.pfx -out /path/to/cert.pem -nodes -clcerts
```

## Option 2: App-Only Auth with Client Secret

### Create a client secret

- In the Entra protal navigate to the app you created earlier
- Select **Certificates & secrets** > **Client secrets** > **New client secret**
- Enter a description for the secret (e.g. `Agent Config`)
- Select **Add**
- Copy the value of the secret, we will use this value in the agent configuration file.

You can now configure Lokka in VSCode, Claude using the config below.

```json
{
  "Lokka-Microsoft": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@merill/lokka"],
    "env": {
      "TENANT_ID": "<tenant-id>",
      "CLIENT_ID": "<client-id>",
      "CLIENT_SECRET": "<client-secret>"
    }
  }
}
```
